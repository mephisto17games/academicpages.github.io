<!---excerpt: "About me"--->


Hey, I'm Enrico, PhD student at the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig investigating the genetic history and profile of human populations in Vietnam.

To our knowledge Southeast Asia and the Sahul continent (former landmass of Australia, Tasmania, and New Guinea) were the first areas which were colonized by early modern humans after the out of Africa migration. Although the highlands of New Guinea and Australia have been relatively isolated, there is evidence for multiple demographic events which shaped Southeast Asia’s and Oceania’s populations within the last 30 thousand years.

I am interested in investigating the genetic history of these regions and for my PhD project I am focusing on the populations of Vietnam as one of the enigmatic parts of Mainland Southeast Asia. By analyzing sequences from both full mitochondrial genomes and the Y chromosome as well as genome wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) I want to reconstruct the evolutionary processes and demographic events that led to the diversity we find in modern day Vietnamese populations.
